# Drop Spread

Control the spread of items dropped on death with a gamerule

## Usage

By default, the dropSpread is set to 0.1, so your items will stay neatly packed together without you changing anything.

However, if you wish to modify this value, the syntax is as follows;

```minecraft
/gamerule dropSpread 1
```

- 1 = vanilla
- 0.1 = mod default, 10% distance of vanilla
- 10 = maximum. why

## Drop Spread of 0.1

## Side

This mod is server-side only. It will do nothing on the client except allow it to function in single-player.
